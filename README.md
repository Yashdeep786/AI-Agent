The AI Agent project is a modular, intelligent software system designed to autonomously perceive, reason, and act in dynamic environments. This project leverages recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in natural language processing (NLP), decision-making, and task automation, to simulate a human-like virtual agent capable of handling complex workflows, answering questions, and performing actions with minimal user input.

Built using Python and integrated with powerful AI frameworks such as OpenAI's GPT models, LangChain, and other open-source tools, this agent can analyze textual input, interact with APIs, retrieve contextual data, and generate intelligent responses or actions. It demonstrates capabilities such as:

Natural Language Understanding: The agent can interpret user commands using large language models (LLMs) to extract intent and execute appropriate actions.

Autonomous Task Execution: It can plan and complete tasks such as web searches, data extraction, summarization, and file operations without constant human intervention.

Memory and Context Management: The system supports short-term memory and long-term memory (via vector databases) to maintain context across multiple interactions.

Modular Tool Use: The agent dynamically selects tools (e.g., browser, calculator, API access) based on task requirements, enabling adaptability and flexibility.

Extensibility: Developers can easily plug in new tools, prompts, or data sources to extend the agentâ€™s functionality.
